# Workshop Overview

Welcome to the **Plotly Dash Workshop**! This hands-on workshop will teach you how to build interactive data visualization dashboards using Plotly Dash.

## What is Plotly Dash?

Plotly Dash is a Python framework for building analytical web applications. It's built on top of:
- **Plotly.js** for interactive visualizations
